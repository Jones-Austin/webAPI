CREATE TABLE carbrands (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,             -- Auto-incrementing integer ID
    carbrand VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE -- Name of the car brand (adjust VARCHAR length as needed)
);

-- Optional: Add an index for faster lookups by name if needed
-- CREATE INDEX idx_carbrand_name ON carbrands(carbrand);
### Connection
Configure the connection string in `db.js` or preferably via environment variables (see Installation section).
The current setup in `db.js` uses SSL (`ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }`), which is often required for cloud database providers like Heroku or Render. Adjust this based on your database hosting requirements.
## 5. Authentication & Security

*   **Authentication:** Currently, no authentication or authorization mechanisms are implemented on the API endpoints. All endpoints are public. For production or sensitive environments, consider implementing authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth2, API Keys).
*   **CORS:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is enabled via the `cors` middleware with the `origin: '*'` setting in `server.js`. This allows requests from any origin. For production, restrict this to only the domains that need access.
*   **Input Validation:** Basic input validation (checking for presence and type) is performed in the controller functions. Parameterized queries are used (`pg` library handles this) to help prevent SQL injection. Consider adding more robust validation libraries (like `joi` or `express-validator`) for complex scenarios.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
*   **HTTPS:** Ensure the API is served over HTTPS in production.

## 6. Deployment Guide

This Node.js application can be deployed to various platforms like Heroku, Render, AWS (EC2, Elastic Beanstalk), Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, etc.

**General Steps:**

1.  **Ensure Code is Version Controlled (Git):** Make sure your latest code is committed.
2.  **Choose a Hosting Platform:** Select a platform that supports `Node.js` applications. Render is a good option since the database is already hosted there.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables:** Set necessary environment variables on the hosting platform:
    *   `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for your PostgreSQL database (recommended).
    *   `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production`.
    *   `PORT`: The platform often sets this automatically; your app should use `process.env.PORT`. (Your current `server.js` uses a fixed port `8004` - adapt it to use `process.env.PORT || 8004`).
4.  **Set Build Command:** Configure the platform to run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install dependencies.
5.  **Set Start Command:** Configure the platform to run `npm start` (or `node server.js`) to start the application.
6.  **Deploy:** Push your code to the platform (e.g., via `git push` for Heroku/Render).

**Example (Conceptual Render/Heroku via Git):**

```bash
# Make sure your Procfile (for Heroku) or Render start command is correct
# e.g., web: npm start

git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
git push origin main # Or your deployment branch (e.g., git push render main)
